<P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE=6>The appellation "Abominable Snowman" was coined in 1921, the same year Lieutenant-Colonel Charles 
Howard-Bury led the 1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition which he chronicled in Mount Everest The Reconnaissance,
 1921.In the book, Howard-Bury includes an account of crossing the Lhakpa La at 21,000 ft (6,400 m) where he found footprints that he 
believed "were probably caused by a large 'loping' grey wolf, which in the soft snow formed double tracks rather like a those of a bare-footed
 man". He adds that his Sherpa guides "at once volunteered that the tracks must be that of 'The Wild Man of the Snows', to which they gave
 the name 'metoh-kangmi'". "Metoh" translates as "man-bear" and "Kang-mi" translates as "snowman"
Confusion exists between Howard-Bury's recitation of the term "metoh-kangmi" and the term used in Bill Tilman's book Mount Everest, 1938 
where Tilman had used the words "metch", which does not exist in the Tibetan language, and "kangmi" when relating the coining of the 
term "Abominable Snowman". Further evidence of "metch" being a misnomer is provided by Tibetan language authority Professor
 David Snellgrove from the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London (ca. 1956), who dismissed the word "metch"
 as impossible, because the consonants "t-c-h" cannot be conjoined in the Tibetan language." Documentation suggests that the term
 "metch-kangmi" is derived from one source (from the year 1921). It has been suggested that "metch" is simply a misspelling of "metoh".
The use of "Abominable Snowman" began when Henry Newman, a longtime contributor to The Statesman in Calcutta, writing under the pen name 
"Kim", interviewed the porters of the "Everest Reconnaissance expedition" on their return to Darjeeling.
 Newman mistranslated the word "metoh" as "filthy", substituting the term "abominable", perhaps out of artistic license. As author Bill 
Tilman recounts, " wrote long after in a letter to The Times: The whole story seemed such a joyous creation I sent it to one or two 
newspapers</FONT>

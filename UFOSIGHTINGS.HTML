<P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE=6>UFO reports have varied widely in reliability, as judged by the number of 
witnesses, whether the witnesses were independent of each other, the observing conditions (e.g., fog, haze, type
 of illumination), and the direction of sighting. Typically, witnesses who take the trouble to report a 
sighting consider the object to be of extraterrestrial origin or possibly a military craft but certainly 
under intelligent control. This inference is usually based on what is perceived as formation flying by sets
 of objects, unnatural—often sudden—motions, the lack of sound, changes in brightness or colour, and strange shapes.
<P>That the unaided eye plays tricks is well known. A bright light, such as the planet Venus, often appears to move.
 Astronomical objects can also be disconcerting to drivers, as they seem to “follow” the car. Visual impressions of 
distance and speed of UFOs are also highly unreliable because they are based on an assumed size and are often made 
against a blank sky with no background object (clouds, mountains, etc.) to set a maximum distance. Reflections from 
windows and eyeglasses produce superimposed views, and complex optical systems, such as camera lenses, can turn point
 sources of light into apparently saucer-shaped phenomena. Such optical illusions and the psychological desire to 
interpret images are known to account for many visual UFO reports, and at least some sightings are known to be hoaxes.
 Radar sightings, while in certain respects more reliable, fail to discriminate between artificial objects and 
meteor trails, ionized gas, rain, or thermal discontinuities in the atmosphere.

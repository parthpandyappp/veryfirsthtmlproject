<P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE=6>Unlike other mysterious phenomenon such as psychic powers, ghosts, or Bigfoot, there is no doubt that crop circles are "real." 
The evidence that they exist is clear and overwhelming. The real question is what creates them.  
Crop circle enthusiasts have come up with many theories about what creates the patterns, ranging from the plausible to the absurd. One explanation in vogue in the early 1980s was 
that the mysterious circle patterns were accidentally produced by the especially vigorous sexual activity of horny hedgehogs. Some people have suggested that the circles are somehow
created by incredibly localized and precise wind patterns, or by scientifically undetectable Earth energy fields and meridians called ley lines.
Many who favor an extraterrestrial explanation claim that aliens physically make the patterns themselves from spaceships; others suggest that they do it using invisible energy
beams from space, saving them the trip down here. Still others believe that it is human, not extraterrestrial, thought and intelligence that is behind the patterns — not in the
form of hoaxers but some sort of global psychic power that manifests itself in wheat and other crops.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE=6>According to some estimates, crop circles appear every week somewhere around the world. The strange circles and patterns appear mysteriously 
overnight in farmers' fields, provoking puzzlement, delight, and intrigue for both locals and the news media. The circles are mostly found in the United Kingdom, but have spread to 
dozens of countries around the world in past decades. But who � or what � is making them?
Many people believe that crop circles have been reported for centuries, a claim repeated in many books and websites devoted to the mystery. Their primary piece of evidence
 is a woodcut from 1678 that appears to show a field of oat stalks laid out in a circle. Some take this to be a first-hand eyewitness account of a crop circle, but a little
 historical investigation shows otherwise.</FONT>

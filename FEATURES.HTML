<P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE=6> Crop circles, as the name implies, almost always involve circles — rarely
 triangles, rectangles, or squares, though some designs contain straight or curved lines.  Perhaps not coincidentally,
 a circle is the easiest pattern for hoaxers to create.Crop circles are formed overnight, often sighted by farmers or 
passersby the next morning. Though there seems no logical reason for extraterrestrials or earth energies to only create 
patterns at night, it is obviously a great advantage for hoaxers to create the designs under the cover of darkness; full
 moon nights are especially popular. Crop circles have never been recorded being made (except, of course, for those 
created by hoaxers). This is a very suspicious trait; after all, if mysterious earthly forces are at work, there's no
 reason to think that they wouldn't happen when cameras are recording. The same thing is true with other explanations
 including alien spacecraft; the only things ever caught on camera making the circles are hoaxers. Most crop circles
 show little or no signs of human contact. While many people consider this very mysterious, in fact it's quite logical:
 Hoaxers who devote the time and effort required to design and create the (often complex) crop circles are unlikely to 
carelessly leave obvious signs of their activities.

Crop circles usually appear in fields that provide reasonably easy public access, close to roads and highways. They 
rarely appear in remote, inaccessible areas. Because of this, the patterns are usually noticed within a day or two of 
their creation by passing motorists.

There are many theories about what creates crop circles, from aliens to mysterious vortices to wind patterns, but they 
all lack one important element: good evidence. Perhaps one day a mysterious, unknown source will be discovered for crop
 circles, but until then perhaps they are best thought of as collective public art.

<P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE=6>In the folklore of Nepal, the Yeti or Abominable Snowman is an ape-like
entity taller than an average human that is said to inhabit the Himalayan region of Nepal, Bhutan and Tibet.
The names Yeti and Meh-Teh are commonly used by the people indigenous to the region, and are part of their history and mythology.
Stories of the Yeti first emerged as a facet of Western popular culture in the 19th century.
The scientific community has generally regarded the Yeti as a legend, given the lack of conclusive evidence.
In one genetic study, researchers matched DNA from hair samples found in the Himalaya with a prehistoric bear 
from the Pleistocene epoch.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE=6>The area referred to as the Bermuda Triangle, or Devil’s Triangle, covers about 500,000
square miles of ocean off the southeastern tip of Florida. When Christopher Columbus sailed through the area on his first 
voyage to the New World, he reported that a great flame of fire (probably a meteor) crashed into the sea one night and that 
a strange light appeared in the distance a few weeks later. He also wrote about erratic compass readings, perhaps because at 
that time a sliver of the Bermuda Triangle was one of the few places on Earth where true north and magnetic north lined up.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE=6>William Shakespeare’s play “The Tempest,” which some scholars claim was based on a real-life 
Bermuda shipwreck, may have enhanced the area’s aura of mystery. Nonetheless, reports of unexplained disappearances did not really 
capture the public’s attention until the 20th century. An especially infamous tragedy occurred in March 1918 when the USS Cyclops, 
a 542-foot-long Navy cargo ship with over 300 men and 10,000 tons of manganese ore onboard, sank somewhere between Barbados and the
Chesapeake Bay. The Cyclops never sent out an SOS distress call despite being equipped to do so, and an extensive search found no 
wreckage. “Only God and the sea know what happened to the great ship,” U.S. President Woodrow Wilson later said. In 1941 two of the 
Cyclops’ sister ships similarly vanished without a trace along nearly the same route.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE=6>A pattern allegedly began forming in which vessels traversing the Bermuda Triangle would either
disappear or be found abandoned. Then, in December 1945, five Navy bombers carrying 14 men took off from a Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 
airfield in order to conduct practice bombing runs over some nearby shoals. But with his compasses apparently malfunctioning, the leader
of the mission, known as Flight 19, got severely lost. All five planes flew aimlessly until they ran low on fuel and were forced to ditch
at sea. That same day, a rescue plane and its 13-man crew also disappeared. After a massive weeks-long search failed to turn up any evidence,
the official Navy report declared that it was “as if they had flown to Mars.”</FONT>

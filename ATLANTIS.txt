<P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE=6> Atlantis, a likely mythical island nation mentioned in Plato’s dialogues “Timaeus”
 and “Critias,” has been an object of fascination among western philosophers and historians for nearly 2,400 years. Plato 
(c.424–328 B.C.) describes it as a powerful and advanced kingdom that sank, in a night and a day, into the ocean around 9,600 B.C. 
The ancient Greeks were divided as to whether Plato’s story was to be taken as history or mere metaphor. Since the 19th century
 there has been renewed interest in linking Plato’s Atlantis to historical locations, most commonly the Greek island of Santorini,
 which was destroyed by a volcanic eruption around 1,600 B.C.</FONT>

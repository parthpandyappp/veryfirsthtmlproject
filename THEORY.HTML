<P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE=6>By the time author Vincent Gaddis coined the phrase “Bermuda Triangle” 
in a 1964 magazine article, additional mysterious accidents had occurred in the area, including three passenger
 planes that went down despite having just sent “all’s well” messages. Charles Berlitz, whose grandfather founded
 the Berlitz language schools, stoked the legend even further in 1974 with a sensational bestseller about the 
legend. Since then, scores of fellow paranormal writers have blamed the triangle’s supposed lethalness on everything
 from aliens, Atlantis and sea monsters to time warps and reverse gravity fields, whereas more scientifically minded
 theorists have pointed to magnetic anomalies, waterspouts or huge eruptions of methane gas from the ocean floor.</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE=6>In all probability, however, there is no single theory that solves the mystery.
 As one skeptic put it, trying to find a common cause for every Bermuda Triangle disappearance is no more logical than
 trying to find a common cause for every automobile accident in Arizona. Moreover, although storms, reefs and the Gulf
 Stream can cause navigational challenges there, maritime insurance leader Lloyd’s of London does not recognize the 
Bermuda Triangle as an especially hazardous place. Neither does the U.S. Coast Guard, which says: “In a review of many
 aircraft and vessel losses in the area over the years, there has been nothing discovered that would indicate that 
casualties were the result of anything other than physical causes. No extraordinary factors have ever been identified.”</FONT>

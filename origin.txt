<P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE=6>Plato’s Critias says he heard the story of Atlantis from his grandfather, who had
 heard it from the Athenian statesman Solon (300 years before Plato’s time), who had learned it from an Egyptian priest, who said 
it had happened 9,000 years before that. Whether or not Plato believed his own story, his intent in telling it seems to have been to 
boost his ideas of an ideal society, using stories of ancient victory and calamity to call to mind more recent events such as the 
Trojan War or Athens’ disastrous invasion of Sicily in 413 B.C. The historicity of Plato’s tale was controversial in ancient times—his 
follower Crantor is said to have believed it, while Strabo (writing a few centuries later) records Aristotle’s joke about Plato’s ability 
to conjure nations out of thin air and then destroy them.</FONT>

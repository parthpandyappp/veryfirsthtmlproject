<P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE=6>In popular culture, the term UFO–or unidentified flying object–refers 
to a suspected alien spacecraft, although its definition encompasses any unexplained aerial phenomena. UFO sightings 
have been reported throughout recorded history and in various parts of the world, raising questions about life on
 other planets and whether extraterrestrials have visited Earth. They became a major subject of interest–and the
 inspiration behind numerous films and books–following the development of rocketry after World War II.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE=6>Plato (through the character Critias in his dialogues) describes Atlantis as an island
 larger than Libya and Asia Minor put together, located in the Atlantic just beyond the Pillars of Hercules—generally assumed to mean 
the Strait of Gibraltar. Its culture was advanced and it had a constitution suspiciously similar to the one outlined in Plato’s “Republic.”
 It was protected by the god Poseidon, who made his son Atlas king and namesake of the island and the ocean that surrounded it. As the 
Atlanteans grew powerful, their ethics declined. Their armies eventually conquered Africa as far as Egypt and Europe as far as Tyrrhenia 
(Etruscan Italy) before being driven back by an Athenian-led alliance. Later, by way of divine punishment, the island was beset by 
earthquakes and floods, and sank into a muddy sea.</FONT>
